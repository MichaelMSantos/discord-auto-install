## How to Use

   Copy the script into a file called `script.sh`:

   ```bash
   nano script.sh
 ```

  Make the script executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh
   ```
  Execute the script with root(sudo) privileges:
  ```bash
  sudo ./script.sh
   ```

**The script will remove the temporary .deb file once installation is completed.**
